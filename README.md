### â™¦ PUBLIC TRANSITION (2025) â™¦

From 2021 to 2024, I independently conceived, developed, and deployed a suite of modular AI recruitment systems â€” including, but not limited to, TalentSyncâ„¢ (sourcing), FitScoreâ„¢ (screening), EngageIQâ„¢ (engagement), and TalentRiskâ„¢ (retention). These systems constitute my exclusive proprietary intellectual property and were made available to enterprise and stealth clients under strict non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).

All performance metrics cited (e.g., match rates, retention accuracy) were tracked across anonymized cohorts and remain reproducible.
Although deployed via client-side infrastructure (e.g., private GitHub repos, internal ATS/CRM systems, LinkedIn automation workflows), all core logic, architectural design, and system IP remain solely owned by me â€” with no transfer, assignment, or licensing of ownership granted.
While all intellectual property remains mine, select deployment results, client-specific configurations, and use-case outcomes are protected under prior NDAs and remain confidential.
In 2025, I began open-sourcing select, non-sensitive modules â€” starting with GitHub, Twitter/X, and Discord integrations â€” to:

â€¢ Share core recruitment logic in the public domain  
â€¢ Promote transparent and ethical AI development  
â€¢ Collaborate with builders on real-world hiring tools  

All releases preserve client confidentiality and comply with NDA obligations.

â€¢ **Resume Parser** (open-source resume parsing logic)
â€¢ **DEI Fit Checker**  
â€¢ **Outreach Assistant**

> **Note**: These tools represent functional subsets of larger proprietary systems â€” shared for learning, research, and ethical collaboration. Commercial replication is not permitted.
