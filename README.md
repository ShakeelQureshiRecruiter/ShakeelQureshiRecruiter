**Senior Technical Recruiter | AI Hiring Systems Architect**  
• 30+ Years Scaling Tech Teams → 3+ Years Automating Hiring with AI

♦ PUBLIC TRANSITION (2025) ♦

From 2021 to 2024, I independently conceived, developed, and deployed a suite of modular AI recruitment systems — including, but not limited to, TalentSync™ (sourcing), FitScore™ (screening), EngageIQ™ (engagement), and TalentRisk™ (retention). These systems constitute my exclusive proprietary intellectual property and were made available to enterprise and stealth clients under strict non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).

All performance metrics cited (e.g., match rates, retention accuracy) were tracked across anonymized cohorts and remain reproducible.
Although deployed via client-side infrastructure (e.g., private GitHub repos, internal ATS/CRM systems, LinkedIn automation workflows), all core logic, architectural design, and system IP remain solely owned by me — with no transfer, assignment, or licensing of ownership granted.
While all intellectual property remains mine, select deployment results, client-specific configurations, and use-case outcomes are protected under prior NDAs and remain confidential.
In 2025, I began open-sourcing select, non-sensitive modules — starting with GitHub, Twitter/X, and Discord integrations — to:

• Share core recruitment logic in the public domain  
• Promote transparent and ethical AI development  
• Collaborate with builders on real-world hiring tools  

All releases preserve client confidentiality and comply with NDA obligations.

### Why Open-Source in 2025?  
After refining these systems in production environments (2021–2024), I’m releasing select modules to:  
• **Foster transparency** in AI-driven hiring (e.g., public scrutiny of bias detection logic)  
• **Enable peer validation** of core recruitment automation principles  
• **Contribute tools** for ethical hiring (GDPR/EEOC-compliant by design)

---

### ▸ Current GitHub Focus:
• Lightweight tools derived from production-grade systems  
• Modular, API-ready logic for resume parsing, DEI scoring, async assessments  
• Clear documentation and working demos for public use

### 🔄 Open-Source Modules vs Proprietary Engines

| Module           | Open-Sourced Version     | Proprietary Equivalent      |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Resume Parser    | Basic NLP Logic          | TalentSync™ Full Pipeline   |
| DEI Fit Checker  | Bias Detection Module    | FitScore™ Multi-Model AI    |

---

### ▸ Live Repository: [github.com/shakeelq](https://github.com/shakeelq)
• **Resume Parser** (open-source resume parsing logic)
• **DEI Fit Checker**  
• **Outreach Assistant**

> **Note**: These tools represent functional subsets of larger proprietary systems — shared for learning, research, and ethical collaboration. Commercial replication is not permitted.
