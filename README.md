## â™¦ PUBLIC TRANSITION (2025) â™¦

From 2021 to 2024, I independently conceived, developed, and deployed a suite of modular AI recruitment systems â€” including, but not limited to, TalentSyncâ„¢ (sourcing), FitScoreâ„¢ (screening), EngageIQâ„¢ (engagement), and TalentRiskâ„¢ (retention). These systems constitute my exclusive proprietary intellectual property and were made available to enterprise and stealth clients under strict non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).

Although deployed via client-side infrastructure (e.g., private GitHub repositories, internal ATS/CRM environments, LinkedIn automation workflows), all core logic, architectural design, and system IP remain solely owned by me, with no transfer, assignment, or licensing of ownership implied or granted.

In 2025, I began open-sourcing select, non-sensitive modules â€” starting with GitHub, Twitter/X, and Discord integrations â€” to:

â€¢ Share core recruitment logic in the public domain  
â€¢ Promote transparent and ethical AI development  
â€¢ Collaborate with builders on real-world hiring tools  

All releases preserve client confidentiality and comply with NDA obligations.

### â–¸ Current GitHub Focus:
â€¢ Lightweight tools derived from production-grade systems  
â€¢ Modular, API-ready logic for resume parsing, DEI scoring, async assessments  
â€¢ Clear documentation and working demos for public use

### â–¸ Live Repository: [github.com/LiveCode](https://github.com/senior-tech-recruiter-ai/LiveCode)
â€¢ **Resume Parser** (LLM + NLP)  
â€¢ **DEI Fit Checker**  
â€¢ **Outreach Assistant**

> **Note**: These tools represent functional subsets of larger proprietary systems â€” shared for learning, research, and ethical collaboration. Commercial replication is not permitted.
