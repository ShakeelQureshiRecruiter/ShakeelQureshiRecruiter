## â™¦ PUBLIC TRANSITION (2025) â™¦

From 2021â€“2024, I architected and deployed proprietary AI recruitment engines â€” including **TalentSyncâ„¢** (sourcing), **FitScoreâ„¢** (screening), **EngageIQâ„¢** (engagement), and **TalentRiskâ„¢** (retention) â€” for enterprise and stealth clients under strict NDAs. While fully white-labeled and deployed via client infrastructure (e.g., private GitHub repos, internal ATS/CRM stacks, LinkedIn workflows), the core systems, architecture, and IP remain solely mine.

In 2025, I began open-sourcing select, non-sensitive components â€” starting with GitHub, Twitter/X, and Discord logic â€” to:


â€¢ Showcase core system architecture  
â€¢ Promote transparent, ethical recruitment AI  
â€¢ Invite collaboration on real-world tools  

All releases respect NDA terms and preserve client confidentiality.

### â–¸ Current GitHub Focus:
â€¢ Lightweight tools derived from production-grade systems  
â€¢ Modular, API-ready logic for resume parsing, DEI scoring, async assessments  
â€¢ Clear documentation with working demos  

### â–¸ Live Repository: [github.com/shakeelq](https://github.com/shakeelq)
â€¢ Resume Parser (LLM + NLP)  
â€¢ DEI Fit Checker  
â€¢ Outreach Assistant  

> **Note**: These are functional subsets of larger proprietary systems â€” shared for learning and collaboration, not commercial replication.
